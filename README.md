gut virome study of multiple diseases (GV_common_diseases)
## Cataloguing and profiling of the gut virome in Chinese populations uncover extensive viral signatures across common diseases

## Abstract
The gut viral community has been linked to human physiology and health, but our knowledge of its genetic and functional contents and disease dependence is far from complete. Here, we collected 11,327 bulk or viral metagenomes from fecal samples from large-scale Chinese populations to establish a Chinese gut virus catalogue (cnGVC) comprising 67,096 nonredundant viral genomes (â‰¥50% completeness). This catalogue included a high proportion (~70%) of novel viruses that are not represented in existing gut viral databases, and allowed us to characterize the functional diversity and specificity of the gut virome. Using cnGVC, we 1) profiled the gut virome in large-scale populations and evaluated their sex- and age-related variations, 2) investigated the diversity and compositional patterns of the gut virome across common diseases by analyzing 6,314 bulk metagenomes spanning 28 disease or unhealthy statuses, and 3) identified a large number of universal viral signatures of diseases and validated their predictive ability for health status. Overall, our resources and results contribute to the grand effort of expanding the knowledge of the human gut virome and addressing the full picture of the associations among viruses and common diseases.
